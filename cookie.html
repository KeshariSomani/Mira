                tracks personal
                information through the use of cookies or similar technologies. In these jurisdictions, the local
                regulation often
                includes an obligation to be clear about what tracking tools (e.g. cookies, flash cookies, web beacons,
                etc.,) your
                website deploys, and what types of personal information these technologies gather. These policies often
                also tell the
                website visitors what is the website doing with the information that was collected.
