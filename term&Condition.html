                and
                Conditions
                (“T&C”) are a set of legally binding terms defined by you, as the
                owner of this
                website. The T&C set forth the legal boundaries governing the activities of the website visitors, or
                your customers,
                while they visit or engage with this website. The T&C are meant to establish the legal relationship
                between the site
                visitors and you as the website owner.

            <p class="text-justify text-[#242424] text-[.9rem]  md:text-[1rem] leading-[1.8rem]">T&C should be defined
                according to
                the
                specific needs and nature of each website. For example, a website
                offering
                products to customers in e-commerce transactions requires T&C that are different from the T&C of a
                website only
                providing information (like a blog, a landing page, and so on).</p>

                you as the
                website
                owner
                the
                ability to protect yourself from potential legal exposure, but
                this may differ
                from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, so make sure to receive local legal advice if you are trying to
                protect yourself from
                legal exposure.</p>
